DESCRIPTION =	"Juno M-Shell calculated with Python 3.9.12 using JRM33+CON2020 between PJ1 (2016-08-27) and PJ56 (2023-11-22) with 1s-resolution. 
	       	Spatial resolution of the field line tracing method is 1/250 Rj ~ 300 km. Outer boundary is set to R=30 Rj (1 Rj = 71,492 km).
	       	JRM33 13th-order coefficients and the analytical version of CON2020 are used for the calculation.
